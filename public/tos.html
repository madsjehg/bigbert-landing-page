    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using bigbert ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you don't agree, please don't use the app. bert will be sad, but he'll understand. (he won't understand.)</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>bigbert is a fitness companion app that provides personalized workout plans generated by AI. The App includes:</p>

      <li>XP and leveling system tied to workout consistency</li>
      <li>Push notification reminders</li>
      <li>An evolving stick figure character (bert)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Not Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>bigbert is not a medical professional. bert is a stick figure. The workout plans provided are generated by AI and are for general fitness purposes only. They do not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>
    <p>You should consult with a qualified healthcare professional before starting any exercise program, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions, injuries, or concerns. Use the App at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>4. Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
    <p>bigbert offers a subscription service billed through Apple's App Store. By subscribing, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase</li>
      <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period</li>
      <li>You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings</li>
      <li>No refunds will be provided for partial subscription periods</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree to use bigbert for its intended purpose: getting fit (or at least making bert think you're trying). You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
      <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the App's systems</li>
      <li>Redistribute or resell the App or its content</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, bigbert and its creators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App. This includes, but is not limited to, injuries sustained while performing workouts suggested by the App.</p>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.</p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to bigbert at any time, for any reason, without notice. You can stop using the App at any time by deleting it from your device and cancelling your subscription.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms. We will update the date at the top of this page when changes are made.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
